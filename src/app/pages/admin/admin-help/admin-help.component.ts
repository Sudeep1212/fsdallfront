          question: 'Can I delete my own admin account?',
          answer: 'No, the system prevents self-deletion. The delete button is disabled for your own account to prevent accidental lockouts. You can edit your account but not delete it.'

          question: 'What if I accidentally delete something?',

          question: 'Can I view user-submitted data?',
